# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

## Description
This project covers the implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists in C. It includes various functions to perform operations such as printing elements, obtaining the length, adding nodes at the beginning and end, freeing the list, retrieving a node at a specific index, computing the sum of elements, inserting a node at a given index, and deleting a node at a specified index.

## Directory Structure
- `0-print_dlistint.c`: Function to print all elements of a doubly linked list
- `1-dlistint_len.c`: Function to return the number of elements in a doubly linked list
- `2-add_dnodeint.c`: Function to add a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list
- `3-add_dnodeint_end.c`: Function to add a new node at the end of a doubly linked list
- `4-free_dlistint.c`: Function to free a doubly linked list
- `5-get_dnodeint.c`: Function to return the nth node of a doubly linked list
- `6-sum_dlistint.c`: Function to return the sum of all elements in a doubly linked list
- `7-insert_dnodeint.c`: Function to insert a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list
- `8-delete_dnodeint.c`: Function to delete a node at a given index in a doubly linked list
- `lists.h`: Header file containing function prototypes
- `README.md`: Informational file about the project
