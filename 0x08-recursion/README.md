## Description

This project is part of a series of C programming tasks aimed at learning and understanding the concept of recursion. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. In this project, we'll be implementing various recursive functions that perform tasks such as printing strings, calculating factorials, checking for prime numbers, and more.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Printing a String with Recursion

Implement a function that prints a string using recursion.

**Prototype:** `void _puts_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 1: Printing a String in Reverse

Implement a function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.

**Prototype:** `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 2: Calculating String Length with Recursion

Implement a function that returns the length of a string using recursion.

**Prototype:** `int _strlen_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 3: Computing Factorial with Recursion

Implement a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

**Prototype:** `int factorial(int n);`

### Task 4: Calculating Power with Recursion

Implement a function that calculates the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.

**Prototype:** `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`

### Task 5: Finding Square Root with Recursion

Implement a function that calculates the natural square root of a number using recursion.

**Prototype:** `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`

### Task 6: Checking Prime Numbers with Recursion

Implement a function that checks if a given number is prime using recursion.

**Prototype:** `int is_prime_number(int n);`

### Task 7: Checking Palindrome Strings

Implement a function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.

**Prototype:** `int is_palindrome(char *s);`

### Task 8: Comparing Strings with Wildcards

Implement a function that compares two strings with wildcards and returns 1 if they are identical, otherwise 0.

**Prototype:** `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`
