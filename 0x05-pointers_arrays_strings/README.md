This repository contains my solutions for the "C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings" project as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The project focuses on fundamental concepts such as pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language.

## Description

This project includes a series of C functions that demonstrate understanding and application of concepts such as pointers, arrays, strings, and basic string manipulation. Each task involves writing a function that performs a specific operation, and the solutions are implemented according to the project requirements and constraints.

## Tasks

The project comprises the following tasks, each of which involves implementing a specific function:

1. `0-reset_to_98.c`: A function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

2. `1-swap.c`: A function that swaps the values of two integers.

3. `2-strlen.c`: A function that returns the length of a string.

4. `3-puts.c`: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

5. `4-print_rev.c`: A function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

6. `5-rev_string.c`: A function that reverses a string.

7. `6-puts2.c`: A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

8. `7-puts_half.c`: A function that prints the second half of a string.

9. `8-print_array.c`: A function that prints a given number of elements of an integer array.

10. `9-strcpy.c`: A function that copies a string, including the null terminator, from the source to the destination buffer.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Compile the C files using a C compiler:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 -o executable-name source-file.c
   ```

3. Execute the compiled executable to test the functions:

   ```
   ./executable-name
   ```

4. Review the provided main files (`*-main.c`) to understand how the functions are tested and used.
