## Description

In this project, I implement singly linked lists, a fundamental data structure, in C. The code demonstrates how to create, manipulate, and free singly linked lists. It includes the following functions:

- `print_list`: Print all elements of a linked list.
- `list_len`: Return the number of elements in a linked list.
- `add_node`: Add a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
- `add_node_end`: Add a new node at the end of a linked list.
- `free_list`: Free the memory allocated for a linked list.

## Project Tasks

1. **Print list:** Implement a function to print all elements of a `list_t` linked list.

2. **List length:** Create a function to return the number of elements in a `list_t` linked list.

3. **Add node:** Write a function to add a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` linked list.

4. **Add node at the end:** Implement a function to add a new node at the end of a `list_t` linked list.

5. **Free list:** Create a function to free the memory allocated for a `list_t` linked list.
