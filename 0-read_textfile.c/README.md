# File I/O in C

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate file input and output (I/O) operations, including reading and writing text files and working with ELF headers. The programs are designed to help you understand and practice fundamental concepts related to file handling in the C programming language.

## Contents

1. **read_textfile.c**: A program that reads a text file and prints its content to the standard output.

2. **create_file.c**: A program that creates a new file and writes text content to it.

3. **append_text_to_file.c**: A program that appends text to an existing file.

4. **cp.c**: A program that copies the content of one file to another.

5. **elf_header.c**: An advanced program that displays information from the ELF header of an ELF file.

## Usage

Each program comes with a usage guide in its respective header comment. You can compile and run these programs on a Linux system.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux system or environment for testing.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Compile the program using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):
