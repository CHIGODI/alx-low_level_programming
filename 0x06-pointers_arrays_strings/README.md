## Description

In this project, we explore advanced concepts in C programming related to pointers, arrays, and strings. The tasks involve implementing various functions that manipulate strings, concatenate strings, copy strings, compare strings, and more. These tasks aim to deepen your understanding of C programming and improve your skills in working with arrays and pointers.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the usage of pointers and how to manipulate them.
- Understand the concept of arrays and their applications.
- Differentiate between pointers and arrays.
- Implement functions to work with strings.
- Grasp the scope of variables in C programming.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder, is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to the Betty coding style. Use `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` for checking.
- The use of global variables is not allowed.
- Each file should not contain more than 5 functions.
- Standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. are forbidden. You can use `_putchar`.
- Your code must include a header file named `main.h` which contains prototypes for all your functions.

## Project Tasks

1. **_strcat:** Implement a function that concatenates two strings.
2. **_strncat:** Implement a function that concatenates two strings while limiting the bytes copied.
3. **_strncpy:** Write a function that copies a string.
4. **_strcmp:** Create a function that compares two strings.
5. **reverse_array:** Implement a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. **string_toupper:** Write a function to change all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.
7. **cap_string:** Implement a function that capitalizes all words in a string.
8. **leet:** Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
9. **rot13:** Create a function that encodes a string using ROT13.
10. **print_number:** Implement a function that prints an integer.
11. **magic:** Add a single line of code to make the program print a specific value.
12. **infinite_add:** Write a function to add two numbers represented as strings.
13. **print_buffer:** Implement a function to print the content of a buffer.

## Getting Started

To use the provided solutions for the tasks in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
   ```

3. Compile the desired task file along with the main test file using `gcc`:

   ```sh
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 task-file.c main-test-file.c -o output-file
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable to test the task:

   ```sh
   ./output-file
   ```

Make sure to replace `task-file.c` with the appropriate task file, `main-test-file.c` with the provided main test file for that task, and `output-file` with your desired output file name.
