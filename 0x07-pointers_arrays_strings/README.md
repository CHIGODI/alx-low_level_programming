## Project Description

This repository hosts solutions to the tasks from the "0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings" project. Each task comes with a detailed description of the problem, and a corresponding solution implemented in C. The tasks cover a range of topics including memory manipulation, string handling, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this repository, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Gain a deeper understanding of advanced pointer usage.
- Work with multidimensional arrays in C.
- Implement various string manipulation techniques.
- Enhance your ability to solve complex programming challenges.

## Task Directory

The repository is organized as follows:

- `0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/`
  - `0-memset.c`: Solution for the "memset" task.
  - `1-memcpy.c`: Solution for the "memcpy" task.
  - `2-strchr.c`: Solution for the "strchr" task.
  - `3-strspn.c`: Solution for the "strspn" task.
  - `4-strpbrk.c`: Solution for the "strpbrk" task.
  - `5-strstr.c`: Solution for the "strstr" task.
  - `6-print_chessboard.c`: Solution for the "print_chessboard" task.
  - `7-print_diagsums.c`: Solution for the "print_diagsums" task.
  - `8-set_string.c`: Solution for the "set_string" task.
  - `101-crackme_password`: Password file for the "crackme2" executable.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the task directory, e.g.:
   ```
   cd 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/
   ```

3. Compile C files using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output_filename>
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./<output_filename>
   ```

5. Follow the task descriptions to solve the programming challenges.
